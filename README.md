* All emissions should use illuminant spectrum

* turn-off every emission and test if the result is empty

* No color ramp

* No Hue saturation value

* Mix between color and Texture not work

* Nodes to take care:

    Principled BSDF

    Mix
    
* Textures must be none-color data

* Clean world texture is necessary

* Be careful when dealing with random
